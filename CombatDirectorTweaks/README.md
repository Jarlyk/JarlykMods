# Combat Director Tweaks
This mod exposes a variety of parameters to tweak how the CombatDirector functions.  Its primary intended purpose is to allow for creating a better experience when hosting large numbers of players in a single game.  The default configuration should do nothing, so you'll need to adjust the configuration as desired.

### Installation
Place CombatDirectorTweaks.dll in your BepInEx\plugins folder.  If you're using a Mod Manager, it may place it under its own folder under plugins, which is also fine.

### Contact
You can reach me via Github or can find me on the modding Discord at https://discord.gg/5MbXZvd.  As with most mods, this is a hobby project, so please understand that response times to questions and time to update for new RoR2 releases may vary.
