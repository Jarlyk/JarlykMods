[//]: # ( Umbrella )

# Umbrella
More tools to help postpone your inevitable demise.  This is currently a rather sparse arsenal, but R&D has more stuff cooking.

## Equipment

### Bullet Timer
Activate to slow projectiles to a crawl; very handy when jumped by Greater Wisps or Elder Lemurians.

### Jester's Dice (Lunar)
Activate to reroll an item on the ground, _but_ it also rerolls an item in your inventory.  For maximum fun, pair with a Gesture of the Drowned and put your faith in the mad prophet of RNG.

## Technical Notes

### Installation
Place JarlykMods.Umbrella.dll in your BepInEx\plugins folder.  If you're using a Mod Manager, it may place it under its own folder under plugins, which is also fine.  Please note that this mod has several dependencies (as visible in the Thunderstore) that will need to be present in order for it to function.

### Contact
You can reach me via Github or can find me on the modding Discord at https://discord.gg/5MbXZvd.  As with most mods, this is a hobby project, so please understand that response times to questions and time to update for new RoR2 releases may vary.

### License
This mod is released under the standard MIT license, which is a permissive license that allows for free use, while disclaiming liability.  The text of this is included in the release archive in License.txt.
