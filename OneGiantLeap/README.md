# One Giant Leap
When you first visit the Lunar surface, the walk through the strange landscape is quite inspiring.  Subsequent visits, however, tend to get a bit tedious.  This mod adds a jump pad near the entrance portal to speed up transit.

### Dependencies
R2API

### Installation
Place JarlykMods.OneGiantLeap.dll in your BepInEx\plugins folder.  If you're using a Mod Manager, it may place it under its own folder under plugins, which is also fine.

### Contact
You can reach me via Github or can find me on the modding Discord at https://discord.gg/5MbXZvd.  As with most mods, this is a hobby project, so please understand that response times to questions and time to update for new RoR2 releases may vary.
