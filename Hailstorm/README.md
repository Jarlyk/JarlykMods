# Hailstorm
Will you stare into the Darkness?  Will you conquer it?  This mod adds new challenges, including some new elites.  This is a work in progress, but it's stable enough at this point to enjoy.  If you run into issues or have constructive suggestions for how to improve the mod, feel free to let me know.

## Features

### Dark Elites
These elites spawn somewhat rarely, but they bring the darkness with them.  When you look in their direction, the darkness closes in.  Look away and it will begin to recede, but eventually you'll need to defeat them.  Find them in the darkness by following their purple spectral light, but try not to get killed by the many other threats unseen.

### Barrier Elites
These elites provide Barrier to their nearby allies while they are alive, so they're a priority target.

### Storm Elites
These elites show up relatively late (around the time that Malachites start spawning) and they're just about as tough.  They bring storms in their wake that dislocate friend and foe alike.

### Mimics
Not all chests are what they appear to be.  Occasionally a chest will reveal itself to be a monster in disguise; beware, for it wields the item that was within the chest and will not yield it until it is dead.

## Technical Notes

### Installation
Place JarlykMods.Hailstorm.dll in your BepInEx\plugins folder.  If you're using a Mod Manager, it may place it under its own folder under plugins, which is also fine.  Please note that this mod has several dependencies (as visible in the Thunderstore) that will need to be present in order for it to function.

### Configuration
After you run the mod once, a configuration file will be created under BepInEx\config.  It is a simple text file with configuration options that are commented as to what they do.  Here you can disable particular features and configure the spawn rate for mimics.

### Contact
You can reach me via Github or can find me on the modding Discord at https://discord.gg/5MbXZvd.  As with most mods, this is a hobby project, so please understand that response times to questions and time to update for new RoR2 releases may vary.
