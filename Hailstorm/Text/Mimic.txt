John: We’ve been stranded here for days. Oddly enough the ground feels like normal dirt, the likes that we find back home. If not for these artifacts dropped from the ship we would’ve been slaughtered long ago by this planet’s foul creatures.

Sarah: It’s OK John. No need to panic. Help will eventually arrive, we only need to hang on for a while longer.

John: Have you lost your mind?! Have you seen the monsters that inhabit this planet!? They’ll get us sooner or later. Help might never come. It’s hopeless.

Sarah: Listen to me john. Look in my eyes. Calm down. With these artifacts we’ve managed to survive for this long. We can do this.

John: Okay. Okay. Deep breaths John. Deep slow breaths..

John: What is it?

Sarah: Are you blind? Look! It’s a Chest! A big one! Let’s go open it!

John: It looks rather...Odd..

Sarah: Oh COME ON you. Stop with the Pessimism! We NEED those Artifacts. Come on hurry up!

Sarah: Hey John? Why won’t it open up? I think you were right, it actually looks different from the Chests we’ve been opening recently.

John: Yeah but I take back what I said, you were right. We need those Trinkets in order to survive. So hurry up and open it.

Sarah: Okay, let's see here..
